Bank Account Management app

This was a good exercise for practicing OOP, TDD and handling lists in Java. Useful lessons I've learnt:

1. First plan on the relationship between objects - what are inherited from parent classes and which classes have unique behavior. 
   - Do not repeat code on methods that are shared by all classes.
2. Write meaningful tests cases before writing the functions to ensure that each requirement can be checked efficiently.
3. Understand how streams and loops in lists are used for working on a large amount of data in apps.
